            When he was little, both of Yasu's parents were killed in a car accident, and was therefore put into the same orphanage as Ren.
            Though he was adopted by the Tagagi couple while still in grade school (at the age of 9), they still remained close as brothers. 
            Later he became the drummer for Ren's band Brute. He is older than the others, and the only one of them who has higher education and their band's leader,
            so Nobu sometimes teases him by calling him "old man". In high school, he dated Reira, but he was jealous of Reira's feelings for Takumi,
            which he later relates as the reasons for their break-up. Ever since he met Nana, Yasu has been an older brother figure for Nana O.
            and sometimes Nobu, and acted as Nana's "guardian" when she arrived in Tokyo. While he admits to being in love with her, he baits Ren to rekindle their love for each other. 
            Ren says that Yasu "always stood back and let [Ren] have what ever he wanted" to Reira in chapter 53. Nana realizes that Yasu will always consider Ren's feelings first,
            and the reason Yasu will never pursue his feelings for Nana is not that he is "a prude" or loves her like a sister, but because she is Ren's girlfriend. 
            He looks after her in place of Ren, who can not.
